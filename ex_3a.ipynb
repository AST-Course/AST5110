    "In the numerical solution we see the initial condition patently evolving into something that looks like a discontinuity. We understand that this discontinuity is formed because the characteristic curves $dx_p/dt = a(x, t, u) = u$ are more inclined (i.e., faster) in a spacetime diagram when starting at elements with larger $u$: since the solution is constant along those curves, the faster elements therefore catch those in front of them which have lower $u$ (as is the case in the solution you have found numerically here) – so the solution must steepen when that happens.\n",

A solution obtained in this way is called a __weak solution__ in mathematics.\n",
