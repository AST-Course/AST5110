For this exercise, use `nm.deriv_cent` and `cfl_cut=0.5`. Describe the most important deviations in the behavior of the simulation that you see compared with the case when $a$ was uniform."

If you know how to integrate ordinary differential equations (or, more simply in this case, how to calculate numerical quadratures), find, using Python, the function $x_p(t)$ that solves equation (2) with initial condition $x_p(t = 0) = x_0$. Then do the same for $x_p(t = 0) = x_f$ . Then, once you have the program working for you, it is easy to calculate the $x_p(t)$ function starting from points in the interior of the interval. With those, draw the solutions for a number of representative initial values."
