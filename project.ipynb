It consists of a one-dimensional flow discontinuity problem that provides a good test of a compressible codeâ€™s ability to capture shocks and contact discontinuities within a few grid zones and produce the correct density profile in a rarefaction or expansion wave. The test can also be used to check if the code can satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump conditions since this test has an analytical solution. If you have access, you can also look at _Computational Gasdynamics book from Culbert B. Laney_ Section 5. However, many other books will describe this problem in detail. \n",
