    "The NS equations are important partial differential equations for various physical problems. In astrophysics, the NS equatinos can be used to describe the dynamics of: stellar atmospheres, accretion disks, inerstellar medium, etc. While being well-known, solving the NS equations is not a trivial task. In this exercise, you may need knowledge from [Introduction-to-PDEs-and-classifications](https://github.com/AST-Course/AST5110/wiki/Introduction-to-PDEs-and-classifications), and [Conservative](https://github.com/AST-Course/AST5110/wiki/Conservative). Understanding the NS equations is also essential for understanding Riemann solvers, and why do we need more stable time integration methods.\n",

    "The compressible NS equations describe mass, momentum, and energy conservation using the continuum __fluid__ assumption, in which case particle behaviours are omiited. Note that incompressible ND equations may have very different mathematical properties, and thus the correspondingly numerical methods can be rather different.\n",
