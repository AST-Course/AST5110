    "The NS equations are important partial differential equations for various physical problems. In astrophysics, the NS equatinos can be used to describe the dynamics of: stellar atmospheres, accretion disks, inerstellar medium, etc. While being well-known, solving the NS equations is not a trivial task. In this exercise, you may need knowledge from [Introduction-to-PDEs-and-classifications](https://github.com/AST-Course/AST5110/wiki/Introduction-to-PDEs-and-classifications), and [Conservative](https://github.com/AST-Course/AST5110/wiki/Conservative). Understanding the NS equations is also essential for understanding Riemann solvers for hydrodynamics, and magnetohydrodynamics.\n",
