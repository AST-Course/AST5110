    "Alfven waves in the solar chromosphere comes with many fequencies and amplitudes. In the chromosphre, ion-neutral interaction can change dissipate and change the Poynting flux. Go from high frequencies (0.1Hz) to 5 minutes oscilations. This parameter range have been observed [Okamoto et al. 2011](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/736/2/L24). How this energy propagates through the atmosphere? Do waves in 1D constant atmosphere, i.e., no gravity nor stratification. Put an initial wave and see how long it takes to dissipate for various frequencies due to the artificial diffusion. What other effects forces do you find? \n",
