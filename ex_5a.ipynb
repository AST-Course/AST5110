Visualize, how `taui_sts` varies with nu and $niter$. Compare the solution with the analytical one for the final STS steps and for intermediate STS steps. For the full STS steps, how improves the solution with $nu$? and $niter$? Is there a relation between these two parameters $nu$ and $niter$ with the error. For which niter and nu the method provides larger steps than an ordinary explicit. For this excercise, fill in `evol_sts`, and `taui_sts`. "
