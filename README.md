## Dependencies

* Anaconda 3 includes most of the required libraries.

* We will have tests to run in CI/CD, so [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) will be convenient. 

* For good practices and clean the code []()

* In addition, you will create your own python library.
As a starting point, fork the
[numerical methods repository for AST5110](https://github.com/jumasy/nm_lib.git).

## Download

In order to solve the excersices, it is highly recommended to create a private fork and provide access to jumasy1980@gmail.com.
This will allow me interactively to follow the progress of each of the students
([fork info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html)).

## Get jupyter-book

If interested to have a notebook of the exersices and wiki, you can download from ([jupyter-book](https://jumasy.github.io/AST5110/AST5110.wiki/Home.html)).
