# AST5110: Numerical Methods in Astrophysics

Welcome to AST5110. This course blends theoretical insights with practical applications, aiming to equip students with a profound understanding of the numerical techniques prevalent in astrophysical research.

## Course Structure

AST5110 unfolds through a series of lectures, interactive discussions, and hands-on exercises, focusing on key topics such as:

- **Discretization**: Delve into discretizing continuous models.
- **Introduction to PDEs and Classifications**: Fundamentals of Partial Differential Equations and their classifications.
- **Errors**: Insight into various computational error types.
- **Stability**: Explore Von Neumann analysis, the CFL condition, and stability principles.
- **Numerical Schemes**: 
  - Hyper Diffusive methods
  - Riemann Solvers
  - Flux Limiters
  - Staggered Mesh techniques
- **Implicit Methods**: 
  - The Newton-Raphson Method
  - Crank-Nicolson in Multidimensions
  - Super Time Stepping
  - Self-similar Solutions for Parabolic Equations
- **Operator Splitting**: Techniques and applications.

## Repository Structure

Our repository is organized into:

- `nm_lib/`: A library of essential functions used throughout the course.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks containing exercises, examples, and projects.
- `AST5110.wiki/`: Extensive wiki pages detailing each covered topic.
- `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`: Setup files to configure the course environment.
