## Material has been collected by: 

* F. Moreno-Insertis (2018).<br>
Course on numerical simulation techniques for fluid dynamics.<br>
Universidad de La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain).

* V. H. Hansteen (2018).<br>
AST 5110 Numerical modeling.<br>
University of Oslo (Oslo, Norway).

* W. H. Press et al..<br>

## Dependencies:

* Anaconda 3 includes most of the required libraries.

* In addition, you will create your own python library. 
As a starting point, fork the 
[numerical methods repository for AST5110](https://gitlab.com/ast5110_course/nm_lib.git).

## Download:
In order to solve the excersices, it is highly recommended to create a private fork and provide access to jumasy1980@gmail.com. 
This will allow me interactively to follow the progress of each of the students 
([fork info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html)). 

# Get jupyter-book: 
If interested to have a notebook of the exersices and wiki, do the following steps in the folder of the exercises:

   git clone git@gitlab.com:ast5110_course/ast5110.wiki.git<br>
   cd ../<br>
   jupyter-book build -W -n --keep-going ast5110/
