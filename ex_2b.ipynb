Then, explain the mathematical behavior of the solution. __Important note__: consider that the initial condition is eq (2) in $[x_0, x_f]$, _with periodic conditions at the boundaries_. In other words, the initial condition consists of an infinite repetition of the function (2) you represented between $[x_0, x_f]$ next to each other. Use this fact when comparing your numerical solution with the analytical one. __Hint__: if you consider points starting within the interval $(x_0, x_f)$ and moving with speed $a$, they will go outside the domain after some time. Use mod operator (\\% in Python) to bring them back into the domain respecting the periodicity of the problem or _numpy.pad_ to pad ghost points, i.e., points out of the numerical domain, which will allow defining the boundaries, at both ends of the numerical domain. NumPy.pad allows various types of boundaries."
